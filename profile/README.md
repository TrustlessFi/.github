# Welcome to Trustless

**Trustless** is a community dedicated to re-building foundational defi protocols that fail to live up to their promises of censorship resistance and decentralization in a maximally Trustless way.

The **Trustless Currency Protocol** allows anyone get debt and own a portion of TCP without fear of being censored. 

**Some of the main features of Trustless Currency Protocol are:**

- Censorship Resistance. TCP was designed to be as extremely difficult to manipulate or control, the only reason blockchain exists in the first place.
- Community Ownership. You will own a portion of TCP if you participate at any time.
- Equitable Genesis. Genesis tokens (20% of the total supply) will be distributed to anyone that participates regardless of how much capital they have.
